# Tic-Tac-Toe

This game of tic-tac-toe will be user vs AI.

After the user makes a valid move, using calls to a Fetch.ai agent, an AI adversary will make a move in response. This will repeat until the game is won, lost, or tied.

Using Deepgram for real-time voice command recognition, a Fetch.ai agent will recognize the user's intended move and continue the game.
